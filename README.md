# English Quiz

This is meant to be a resource for native Chinese speakers to learn English. 

Right now, the main part is the English Quiz, which tests users' knowledge of the different parts of speech in the English language.

Future features: I'd like to add a listening comprehension section, and pronunciation resources.

To run: "npm start", and have postgres running if you'd like to login or create an account.
